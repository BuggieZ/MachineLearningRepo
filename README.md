*The overview of ML*
https://github.com/BuggieZ/MachineLearningRepo/blob/main/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf(Overview of ML.pdf)
This notebook is a subjective understanding and brief summary of ML.


*Homework on Data exploration* 
[https://github.com/BuggieZ/MachineLearningRepo/blob/85220be6cae4a19a923649c7d0957169a5bd4c60/hw_dataExplooration.docx](https://github.com/BuggieZ/MachineLearningRepo/tree/main/HW_C%2B%2B_Algos)
In this notebook. I used C++ to read in a simple Exel data - a statistics of Boston housing prices in relation of the room number and median home value.  
Learned the basic attribute of data such as range, mean, covariance, and correlation between input variables.


*Homework R noteBook on Linear regression*

*Analysis*:https://github.com/BuggieZ/MachineLearningRepo/blob/main/HW_linear%26LogisticRegression/Linear%26Logistic_Reg.docx
In above notebooks, you can find the linear regression and Classfication performed on a dataset "Adult.csv".
Withink this notebook you can find the linear models and glm used to try to find the correlatipon between income and other variables.


*Portfolio Component: Searching for Similarity*
https://github.com/BuggieZ/MachineLearningRepo/tree/main/DimensionalityReduction
Within this notebook. My group had tried using LDA ,PCA Clustering and KNN, as well as Decision trees for dimensionality reducing on various datasets.
On the part I worked on, I used PCA and LDA to reduce the data from 13 to 2 variables. Then performed classfication with predictor as the emission.

*SKlearn using Python*
https://github.com/BuggieZ/MachineLearningRepo/tree/main/HW_skLearn
Using SKLearn seaborn and panda as tools plopted graphs between predictor column MPG and other factors within the dataset.
Performed logistic regression with solver lbfg to evaluate the model. 
Build model clf and outputed using decisiontree plot.


*ImageClassification with TensorFlow*
https://github.com/BuggieZ/MachineLearningRepo/tree/main/HW_ImageClassification
Using tensorflow on image classfication.
